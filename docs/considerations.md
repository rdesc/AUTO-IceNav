# Coordinate system for the simulation

In contrast to the coordinate system described in the paper, the coordinate system used throughout
this code base is y positive up (i.e., parallel to channel length) and x positive to the right.
This makes it easy to use the image coordinates directly as the world coordinates in the simulation.
